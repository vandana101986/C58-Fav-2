        <p>Obbattu is also called as holige, bele obbattu or puran poli. It is basically a sweet flat bread recipe prepared mainly with all purpose flour with chana dal and jaggery stuffing. It is one of the popular sweet recipes, prepared especially during the festival seasons or during religious ceremony.<br><br>
            In karnataka, it is prepared with variety of stuffing. the most common oneâ€™s are with rava / semolina, chana dal, toor dal, coconut and even mixed dry fruits. but my personal favourite recipe is kaayi obbattu and bele obbattu. most commonly i prepare either of them especially during ganesh chaturthi, Ugadi and during maraka sankrathi festival.
